Import your properties directly from your real-estate management software!

== Description ==

Synchronize your properties directly to CASAWP, and let them be automatically categorized. Adjust the plugin to any theme. CASAWP imports the most common standards with the help of CASAGATEWAY without a hitch.

*** This plugin requires at least PHP 8.1

*** For further technical infos concerning this plugin refer to the readme.md file included within the plugin files.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "casawp" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Setup your import method (see "Import Setup" for further instructions).
4. Check out yourdomain.com/immobilien to verify that it works
5. Adjust the theme files to your liking

== Import Setup ==
The plugin will look for a file in "wp-content/uploads/casawp/import/data.xml" and syncronize this data with your WordPress installation.

You can place the XML file through FTP/Rsync or something similar.

If you are unable to export to the CASAXML standard with your management software, we can provide you with a CASAGATEWAY account so that you may convert (OpenImmo, HomegateXML, etc.) on the fly.
You will then only need to add the API and SECRET keys to the plugin's options.

Please refer to casasoft.ch[https://casasoft.ch/casagateway] for further instructions.
